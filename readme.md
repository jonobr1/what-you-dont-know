# What You Don't Know
A interactive music video made for VR only on [WITHIN](http://with.in/) in partnership with [Ghostly International](http://ghostly.com/). With music by [Matthew Dear](https://ghostly.com/artists/matthew-dear).

## Project Environment

There are three main resources for this project:
+ [/inspiration](./inspiration): Visual inspiration links for the project
+ [/release](./release): The current stable build for the project
+ [/staging](./staging): The latest build for the project
+ [/editor](./editor): A WYSIWYG timeline editor for the project
+ [/prototypes](./prototypes): All interaction prototypes

These folders all require you run a local server on your computer. A good cross-platform way to get that started is by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), opening up a command line prompt, and typing `npm install -g http-server`. Once you have that, point your command line to this project's root directory and type `http-server`. This will create a local server at `http://localhost:8080`. The following instructions will use this local server's details as the example.

Below are more details for each of the pages and how to use them.

### /release
[http://within-unlimited.github.io/what-you-dont-know/release/](http://within-unlimited.github.io/what-you-dont-know/release/) is the most current place to see our current build of the project.

### /staging
[http://within-unlimited.github.io/what-you-dont-know/staging/](http://within-unlimited.github.io/what-you-dont-know/release/) is the build used for WITHIN's staging website.

### /editor
[http://within-unlimited.github.io/what-you-dont-know/editor/](http://within-unlimited.github.io/what-you-dont-know/editor/) gives you an empty viewport to see and manipulate how we're choreographing _What You Don't Know_. Once this is open in your web browser go to `File > Reset` to insure the a clean version of the project is loaded. When doing this, the editor loads `/release/experience.json` into the editor, insuring that what you're working with is the published version of the project. Similar to video editing software you can hit the spacebar to play and pause the video with some additional controls to see how animations are laid out.

### /prototypes
[http://within-unlimited.github.io/what-you-dont-know/prototypes/](http://within-unlimited.github.io/what-you-dont-know/prototypes/) is a list of one off HTML5 webpages exploring different interactions, graphics, interfaces, and previous builds.
